        If you choose to use my Service, then you agree
        to the collection and use of information in relation to this
        policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
        used for providing and improving the Service.
        I will not use or share your

        Policy.
      </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
        For a better experience, while using our Service,
        I may require you to provide us with certain
        personally identifiable information. The
        information that I request will be
        retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

        information used to identify you.

          Link to privacy policy of third party service providers
          used by the app
       
        I want to inform you that whenever
        you use my Service, in a case of an error in the
        app I collect data and information (through third
        party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data
        may include information such as your device Internet
        Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system
        version, the configuration of the app when utilizing
        my Service, the time and date of your use of the
        Service, and other statistics.
      </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are

        use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
        services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
        these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your
        device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be
        able to use some portions of this Service.
      </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
        I may employ third-party companies
        and individuals due to the following reasons:
     
        I want to inform users of this
        Service that these third parties have access to your
        Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
        assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
        not to disclose or use the information for any other
        purpose.
      </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
        I value your trust in providing us
        your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
        commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
        that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
        of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
        I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click
        on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
        Note that these external sites are not operated by
        me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
        review the Privacy Policy of these websites.

        responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or

      </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
        I do not knowingly collect personally
        identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
        I discover that a child under 13 has provided
        me with personal information,
        I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
        are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
        has provided us with personal information, please contact
        me so that I will be able to do
        necessary actions.
      </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>

        time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. I will
